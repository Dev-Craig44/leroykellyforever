# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## 📨 Email Infrastructure Setup (Production-Ready Foundation)

To ensure professional outreach and reliable email deliverability, I implemented custom domain email infrastructure for LeroyKellyForever.com.

### Domain & Email Setup

- Purchased `leroykellyforever.com`
- Configured Google Workspace (Business Starter)
- Created branded sender address:
  - `info@leroykellyforever.com`

### Deliverability & Authentication

- Verified domain ownership in Mailchimp
- Implemented DKIM authentication
- Configured DNS records via Google-managed domain
- Tested inbox placement between external accounts

### Why This Matters

This setup prevents:

- “via mailchimp.com” warnings
- Spam classification from shared Gmail senders
- Brand credibility loss during outreach

It establishes:

- Verified sender identity
- Improved deliverability score
- Scalable infrastructure for future campaigns
